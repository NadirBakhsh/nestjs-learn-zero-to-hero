# Step 01 - Introduction to NestJS

1. What is NestJS?
    Nest is a framework. for building efficient, scalable, Node.js server-side applications with
    fully supports TypeScript. Under the hood Express (the default) and nodejs is used and optionally 
    can be configured to use Fastify as well! his gives developers the freedom to use the myriad of third-party modules which are available for the underlying platform.

2. Why we are not going to use Node.js and Express directly?
    We're not using Node.js or Express directly because with the introduction of Nest.js,
    there's now a standardized structure and pattern for writing code. Many developers and companies have their own unique ways of working and writing code, 
    which can make it difficult for teammates to understand. Nest.js, with its modular and organized approach,
    makes it easier to maintain scalability and maintainability in the codebase.
